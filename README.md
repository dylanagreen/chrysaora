# Chrysaora

Chrysaora is an attempt to code a "self-learning" chess engine. This is not a self learning chess engine in the sense that Leela Zero is, but rather is based on a convolutional neural network. Instead of hand coding an algorithm to determine white/black advantage, Chrysaora serves as an experiment where I'll try and let a computer determine its own algorithm.

This, of course, means the algorithm will be heavily tainted by the training data used. For example, if I train it using boards generated by Stockfish, where I use Stockfish's decision on whether a board is white or black advantage, I'll probably inadvertently create an engine that runs pretty similarly to Stockfish, but we'll see. 

CNN work is done using PyTorch, with any math and vector math handled by NumPy and SciPy.
